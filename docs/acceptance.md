# Production acceptance gates

Structurely is complete only when all gates are evidenced on pinned fixtures.

## Correctness

- Clean and incremental graph snapshots are byte-for-byte deterministic.
- Line-only and comment-only edits preserve symbol IDs.
- Every relationship contains valid evidence and a confidence in `[0, 1]`.
- Differential MCP fixtures preserve required CodeGraph fields.
- Injected rollback cannot expose a partially updated graph epoch.

## Quality

- TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, and Rust have executable semantic fixtures.
- Relationship precision and recall are reported in aggregate and per language.
- Framework resolver adapters require adversarial fixtures and two real repos.

## Performance

- Common one-file changes become query-visible within 300 ms on the pinned
  semantic fixture in Linux CI.
- Large-repository end-to-end indexing is at least 2x the pinned CodeGraph
  baseline on an identical file intersection.
- Peak memory is sublinear in worker count.
- WAL growth is bounded and checkpointed.

## Product

- CLI and MCP compatibility suites pass on Linux, macOS, and Windows.
- Install, upgrade, uninstall, telemetry policy, and troubleshooting are
  documented.
- Release artifacts have checksums and build provenance.
